                        <h3>Communication skill</h3>
                        <p>Communication is the most important thing I want to learn from this intern, my past experience on course project made me know that communication
                            played a key role in the successful of a project/task. A good communication skill and environment could increase productivity and efficiency. I 
                            would like to work in different people and place to improve my communication skill.

                        <h3>My motivations</h3>
                        <p>I want to make something useful. Originally I choose this major because I like playing game. After I learned several years studies, I found that to be
                            an engineer is not just for a job, I could create a web or application to help my family, friend or myself. Using current knowlegde to create meaningful
                            things, I think that's my motivation to be an engineer. And I want to create softwares that one day could help people in daily life.
